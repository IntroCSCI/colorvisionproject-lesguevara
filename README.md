### Variables and Data Types

!!!
I have included multiple variables in order to effectively identify the color options. Other variables I have included also allow me to properly identify a file, as well as read, open, and write to a file.
!!!

### Console Input and Output

!!!
With the input function, I was able to gather a preffered color, as well as a preferred name for a file. With this information I was then able to use the input function to insert the other color combinations into the file
